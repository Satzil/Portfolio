This project integrates OpenCV, YOLOv5, and EasyOCR to develop an efficient license plate detection system. OpenCV provides foundational image processing, YOLOv5 enables real-time object detection, particularly focusing on license plates, and EasyOCR seamlessly extracts and recognizes license plate characters.

# Text Sequence Generation using NLP

Text Sequence Generation using NLP is a model or system designed to generate coherent and contextually relevant text sequences. These generators utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and often rely on deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
