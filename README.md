This project integrates OpenCV, YOLOv5, and EasyOCR to develop an efficient license plate detection system. OpenCV provides foundational image processing, YOLOv5 enables real-time object detection, particularly focusing on license plates, and EasyOCR seamlessly extracts and recognizes license plate characters.

The "AI Body Language Detection" project employs Mediapipe, a custom classification model, and OpenCV to analyze and interpret human body language in real-time, focusing on classes such as "happy," "sad," and "victorious." By combining state-of-the-art pose detection with a specialized classification algorithm, the system provides insights into the emotional state and expressions of individuals.

# Text Sequence Generation using NLP

Text Sequence Generation using NLP is a model or system designed to generate coherent and contextually relevant text sequences. These generators utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and often rely on deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
